## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. This program only works on Windows.

### Prerequisites

You need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your computer.

### Installing

You need to install npm packages before continuing

```
npm install
```

after you install packages, all you need to do is

```
npm start
```

and it would print a table of your IPv4 adresses. By default, it'll run at [4540](https://eksisozluk.com/4540-merkez--3607686) port.


```
